# Challenge 1 (cat: not the pet, the command)
One of the most critical Linux commands is cat. cat is most often used for reading out files.
cat can concatenate multiple files if provided multiple arguments. 

```sh 
hacker@dojo:~$ cat myfile
This is my file!
hacker@dojo:~$ cat yourfile
This is your file!
hacker@dojo:~$ cat myfile yourfile
This is my file!
This is your file!
```

## solution 

```sh 
/home
bash: /home: Is a directory
cat flag
pwn.college{4Ttd54pJKnFBv2v_V7xbGksT9Uc.QXxcTN0wSOyAzNzEzW}

## Flag
```sh
pwn.college{4Ttd54pJKnFBv2v_V7xbGksT9Uc.QXxcTN0wSOyAzNzEzW}
```

# Challenge 2(catting absolute paths)
In the last level, you did cat flag to read the flag out of your home directory! You can, of course, specify cat's arguments as absolute paths:


## solution 
this time the flag isn't available at the home directory.

```sh
cat /flag
pwn.college{YX4tHBKKBs1oM66nm4bpYDAxm-C.QX5ETO0wSOyAzNzEzW}
```

# Challenge 3 (comparing files)
When looking for changes between similar files, eyeballing them might not be the most efficient approach! This is where the diff command becomes invaluable.

diff compares two files line by line and shows you exactly what's different between them. For example:

```sh
hacker@dojo:~$ cat file1
hello
world
hacker@dojo:~$ cat file2
hello
universe
hacker@dojo:~$ diff file1 file2
2c2
< world
---
> universe
```

## solution 
compare the two files /challenge/decoys_only.txt
/challenge/decoys_and_real.txt using diff

```sh
diff /challenge/decoys_only.txt /challenge/decoys_and_real.txt
97a98
> pwn.college{Uj_PwpB5GvSjpiDIrcySN2hxZwW.01MwMDOxwSOyAzNzEzW}
```

## flag:

```
pwn.college{Uj_PwpB5GvSjpiDIrcySN2hxZwW.01MwMDOxwSOyAzNzEzW}
```

# Challenge 4 (listing files)


# Challenge 5 (touching files)

## flag:
pwn.college{0iz9LzTNk08NfxDB-Wu1NUVnx4f.QXwMDO0wSOyAzNzEzW}


# Challenge 6 (removing files)


## flag:
pwn.college{Q4cjU-5iOA6oZEqa_cxLH0dI8oL.QX2kDM1wSOyAzNzEzW}
